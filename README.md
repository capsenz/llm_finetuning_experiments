# LLM Finetuning Experiments

## Install the environment
If you have not installed poetry you would need to [install](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) it.

Then run
```
poetry install
```
If `poetry` was setup correctly, you can then run
```
poetry shell
```
which activates the virtual environment.

## Current ideas

Finetune the model to be an "entertainment machine". Possible datasets that could serve as a basis to create triplets for the finetuning:
- [rJokes Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04833.pdf)
- [WritingPrompts Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04833.pdf)
- [PuzzleQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jingmiao/PUZZLEQA)
